Super Tux 0.1.2 (upcoming release)
=====================
  * one new island containing contributed and "official" new levels
  * a "new" enemy: The Fish
  * support for auto-scrolling levels
  * extended world map format, support for contributed world maps
  * thrown ice blocks destroy wooden crates now
  * minor bug fixes

This is a nice list of the new additions, but I think it gives the impression
that a lot of stuff has been added and the fact is that basically, it is just
a release that has a new world.
What about making it smaller and highlighting the new world (that is the purpose
of the release), something like this:

  * a brand new island containing 20 contributed and "official" levels! Have fun!
  * a "new" enemy: The Fish
  * support for auto-scrolling levels
  * some gameplay aditions: improved world map and support for Mr. Ice Blocks to
destroy wooden crates when flat
  * minor bug fixes
