Supertux Release 0.3.0 (2006-12-17)

This release of supertux features a second worldmap with all new
levels and new badguys. The game engine allows scrolling in all four
directions, World1 is no longer linear, so you don't have to play
all levels to advance to world2.
Configuration and savegames are stored in ~/.supertux2 now.
