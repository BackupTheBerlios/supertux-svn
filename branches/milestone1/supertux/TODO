SuperTux 0.1.2 TO 0.1.3 - TODO

*Fix reset point bugs: [done?]
  -not working when placed at certain locations (see bonus2/level17 for an example)
  -if you respawn at a rp and walk left, you start at the beginning next time
  [added warnings about reset points inside a wall]
*build levels, check contributed ones:
  -complete levels 17-20
  -High Gravity cannot be finished
  -check reset points in all levels
* Status (small/big/fire) gets reset when aborting a level
  (i.e. start a level as big Tux, get small, abort -> Tux is big again)
* Check life counter: do you get the last life twice?
* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=259974 (patch included!)
* add .desktop file
