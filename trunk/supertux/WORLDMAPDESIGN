This document describes how to edit a world map.

= EDITING WORLDMAP TILES =

To edit a World Map, please use FlexLay. Thought it might have problems with
the editing of level and special tiles, since it isn't sync with CVS.

= AVAILABLE SPECIAL TILES =

These are the available special tiles (even if 0_1_1 branch has some of them,
they will most likely have different names or used in another way):

; This is a comment!

(special-tile
; X and Y position [NECESSARY]
 (x 10)
 (y 14)

; If this is a level:
 (level "file_name.stl")

; Flip the level vertically [NEEDS: level] - default: false
 (vertical-flip #t)

; Stop auto-walking - default: false
 (auto-path #f)

; Add a message tile. You can also use this together with a teleporter.
 (map-message "Hello World!"

; Instead of showing a fix message, show while the player
; passes by [NEEDS: map-message]- default: false
 (passive-message #t)

; Apply action only in this/these direction(s) [WORKS FOR: passive-message] -
; default: true for all - possible values: north/south/east/west.
; More than one can be used with a separator or not
 (apply-to-direction "north-east")

; Add a teleporter tile to
 (teleport-to-x 20)
 (teleport-to-y 13)

; Don't show this tile [WORKS FOR: level, teleporter, map-message]
 (invisible-tile #t)

; Show this text file after completing this level [NEEDS: level]
 (extro-filename "filename")

; Go to this world after completing this level [NEEDS: level]
 (next-world "worldmap.stwt)

; Exit world map after completing this level [NEEDS: level]
 (exit-game #t)

) ; end of special-tile
