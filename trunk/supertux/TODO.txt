ToDo for Milestone1
===================

- you can pick up more than 1 mr iceblock
- not all levels have a correctly placed igloo yet
- supertux crashs from time to time
- some enemies can't be bumped anymore
- there's no effect if you bump specials
- leveleditor is incomplete (maybe we shoudl deactivate it?)
- sometimes you die after being and pause modus and unpausing
- enemies start running backwards, when they collide with a flame
- fast music restart again and again
- time is displayed negatively when tux dies because of timeout
- supertux lifting its feet for kicking is not drawn
- egg gets removed when leaving the screen, while badguys don't or at
  least much later, thus its not possible to wait for an egg that
  would bounce back
