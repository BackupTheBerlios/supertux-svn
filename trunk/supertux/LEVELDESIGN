= BUILT-IN LEVEL EDITOR =


//FIXME: Check if all the informations are still valid, when releasing 0.0.6.
USING THE BUILT-IN LEVEL EDITOR:
--------------------------------

The built-in level editor can already be used for
production, but more advances are expected in the
future, including a mouse driven interface.

When opening the leveleditor, a menu will appear. This
menu can be used to add, edit, load, save and test levels.

Menu entries:
- Return to Level Editor - just closes the menu and goes
to the editing mode. To come back to the menu, press Esc.
- New Level - creates a new level. The number of the level
is showed in the upper left part of the screen. The level
file are currently placed on data/levels/default.
- Test Level - if you want to test the current level, use
this option.
- Level Settings - this allows you to edit the header of the
file (as described in the beggining of this document). An
important field is the 'Level width' that allows you to
adjust level's size.
(Warning: there are some characters that do not work, cause
they are not supported by the fonts)
- Load Level - goes to a given level number.
- Save Level - saves the current level.
- Quit Level Editor - goes back to SuperTux's main menu.

Editing mode:
To edit the level, you'll have to use the mouse or the
keyboard to control the red cursor, using the keyboard
to change tiles. Tiles keys are the same used by the
level format, listed above. You can check them in the fly,
pressing F1. I'd suggest you to print the above list of keys.
In the future, a mouse interface will be introduced.

To go back to the menu, just press Esc.

Now, do lots of levels and HAVE FUN!!

Please, send your levels or any art you created to the SuperTux's
mailinglist or to the maintainer (look at AUTHORS.txt).
