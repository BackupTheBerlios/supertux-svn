DESCRIPTION
-----------
  SuperTux is a jump'n run like game, with a strongly inspiration on
  Nintendo's Super Mario Bros games.
  Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
  on them or bumping them from below.  Grabbing power-ups and other stuff
  on the way.


STORY
-----

- Gwen gets captured! -

  Tux and Gwen were out having a nice
  picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
  Suddenly, a creature jumped from
  behind an ice bush, there was a flash,
  and Tux fell asleep!

  When Tux wakes up, he finds that Gwen
  is missing. Where she lay before now
  lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"
  says the letter. "I have captured
  your beautiful Gwen and have taken her
  to my fortress. The path to my fortress
  is littered with my minions. Give up on
  the thought of trying to reclaim her,
  you haven't a chance! -Nolok"

  Tux looks and see Nolok's fortress in
  the distance. Determined to save his
  beloved Gwen, he begins his journey.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
  Important documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.
  Please see them:

    AUTHORS    - Credits for who made this game.
    CHANGES    - Changes since the previous versions of "Super Tux"
    COPYING    - The GNU Public License, which "Super Tux" is under.
    INSTALL    - Instructions on requirements, compiling and installing.
    README     - (This file.)  Game story, usage, rules and controls.
    TODO       - A wish-list for this version of "Super Tux"


RUNNING THE GAME
----------------
  SuperTux makes use of proc to see where it is. In other words, it does not
  have any need to be installed and can be run from anywhere. This makes
  it possible to click in the executable in your filemanager (ie. Konqueror,
  Nautilus) as oposited to most of Linux games.

  Options can be reached from the menu, so you don't need to specify arguments,
  but if you want, type 'supertux --help' to check the ones that are avaible.
  Also, notice that SuperTux saves the options, so you don't need to be allways
  specifying them.

  The game has two frontends: SDL and OpenGL. Currently, there isn't any
  noticiable difference between them.
  Basically, SDL uses software to draw the game and OpenGL makes use of
  the videocards cpu (in case the videocard has one and the drivers support
  it). Under linux, nvidia is recommendaded (with the closed drivers), but
  an ATI should work just fine.


PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
  Controls
  --------
  Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change the
  controls via the Options menu.
  Basically, the only keys you will have to use is for the following actions:
  jump, duck, right and left. Also press Esc to go to the menu and use the
  key cursors and Enter under it. Oh, press P to pause the game.
  In the worldmap, the arrow keys and Enter are enough.

  The leveleditor is controled via the mouse, but there are shortcuts that
  may make your life easier. To see the shortcuts for the buttons, just
  do a Right-click on them.
  In any case, we advise you to read LEVELDESIGN to have the best productivity
  with the leveleditor.


SCREEN LAYOUT
-------------
  Status
  ------
    The amount of time you have left to complete this level is displayed in
    the center at the top of the screen.  (Note: Time is NOT in seconds!)

    The number of coins you have collected is displayed at the upper right.

SCORING
-------
  Enemies
  -------
    If you get more than one enemy at a time without landing on the ground,
    each enemy is worth more points.  For example, if there are three in a
    row and you jump on the first, it's worth 50 points.  If you bounce off
    the first and onto the second, it's worth 100 points.  If you also get
    the third, it's worth 150 points.

    You can also score by shooting at the ennemies. Don't forget to get
    the flower in order to get the ability to fire.


OPTIONS FILE
------------

  When Super Tux starts up, it looks for an options file.

  Under Linux, this file is "config" in your directory
  ($HOME/.supertux/).
  Under Windows, this file is "supertux.dat" in the Super Tux folder.
  
  This file records program's settings. It uses the LISP syntax, anyway
  there shouldn't be any reasons for you to hand edit it.
