REQUIREMENTS
------------

  SDL
  ---
    The Simple DirectMedia Layer, a set of libraries made to simplify
    access to multimedia functions of various platforms, is required
    to compile this game.

    You can download the SDL libraries from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/

  SDL_image
  ---------
    SDL_image, an image-loading library based on SDL, is also required.

    You can download SDL_image from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

  OpenGL
  ------
    OpenGL is a graphics library that your system should already
    have (it is preinstalled on Windows and should be available
    in your X11 distribution on Unix systems).

    To have the best performance possible, you should have an
    accelerated graphics card and use its vendor's drivers. Currently,
    only NVidia writes decent drivers for Linux, but since only
    accelerated 2D is used, the performance on ATI or other graphics
    cards shouldn't be significantly worse.

    You will need the OpenGL headers to compile SuperTux, so it is
    advisable to first install Mesa (which should be included with your
    X11 distribution) on Unix to get the headers and only then replace
    the software rendering OpenGL library by installing the driver for
    your graphics card.

  PhysicsFS
  ---------
    PhysicsFS provides a Quake 3-like data access method.

    You can get PhysicsFS and more information about it from:
      http://icculus.org/physfs/

  Jam
  ---
    If you want to build SuperTux, you will need Jam, a build system by
    Perforce. Extract the archive on your hard disk, run make and copy
    the compiled binary (in the bin.<platform> directory) into your PATH
    (e.g. /usr/bin).

    You can download Jam from:
      ftp://ftp.perforce.com/jam/


INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Note: Read this entire section before you start issuing commands!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  SuperTux uses a script that checks for dependencies and disables
  features in case the requirements are not met.
  The script is named configure and you can specify a few parameters
  like the directory to which you want to install SuperTux
  (by supplying the argument --prefix=/usr/local). For more
  information, type './configure --help'.
  (Note: SuperTux does not need to be installed on the system,
  you can run it from its own directory.)

  If no configure script exists (e.g. in case you've retrieved SuperTux
  from SVN), just run the autogen.sh script. You'll need autoconf
  for this.

  To compile SuperTux, a 'jam' is enough.
  Type 'jam install' (as root) to copy it into the system.
  (By default, SuperTux installs itself into /usr/local, see above how
  to change this behaviour.)

  So, in short, just type:
  sh autogen.sh (in case there isn't any configure file already)
  sh configure
  jam

  And in case you want to install SuperTux into the system:
  jam install (as root)


ICON FILE
---------
  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file is available if you wish to use
  an icon for a menu entry for this game.

  The file is "supertux.xpm", and can be found in the
  data/images/engine/icons/ directory.
