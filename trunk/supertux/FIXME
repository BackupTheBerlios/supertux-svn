SUPERTUX FIXME'S
This file is for small, obvious and temporary issues that are too minor to be put into the TODO at the wiki.
Just put them here so you don't forget.

Tux is invisible!
Some sound effects (growup, being hit) loop endlessly
Some levels don't have the music path set correctly
Revert Tux to single image sprite
