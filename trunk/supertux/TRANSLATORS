 == TRANSLATORS ==

1. Notes for Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If there isn't a good translation for some term (ie. fullscreen), you might consider
  to just keep it. It's better than making the user confused.

* In English, there is only one singular second person mode (You). If your language does
  have more than one - a personal and impersonal - remember that this is a game, so you
  should use the personal one. And if it is possible to ommit it in your language, it might
  be a good idea.

* Names like SuperTux, Tux, Penny or Nolok should not be translated. If you
  really think one of these to be a too strange word for your people, first inform us at
  our mailing list.
  Minor characters like Mr. Ice Block can (and should) be translated.

A couple of notes:
* If somewhere in the game, after translating a string, it doesn't look well (bad
  aligment, overlaps other text...), let us know - will be fixed.

* Currently, only the game itself is translatable. Data files, like levels,
  credits, story... are not yet translatable.

All in all, translating lots of strings can be boring and time consuming, but it
worths when lookins at the results ;-)

2. Programs to Aid Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 KBabel      - a long dated KDE program that has been maturing over the years, and it's
               really handy by now.
 (X)Emacs    - a commonly used program for translating with the respective plugin.
 QTranslator - made by Qt, has the advantage of running in several platforms.
 PO files are written in ASCII and are pretty intuitive, so they can be used by any text
 editor. But it would be wise to use a program made for that effect. If not possible,
 use a text editor with highlighting for PO files.


 If all of this is new to you, the translation file that you should use is the supertux.pot
 that is inside the po/ root folder. Rename it to your language (ie. Spanish - es.po) and
 then open it with an appropriate program.
 After translating the file, add an entry of your language to the LINGUAS file (ie. Spanish - es)
 and run 'make update-po'. Then a binary file will be created. In order to make SuperTux using
 it, you will have to install it ('make install').

 To translate data files, you'll have to use a text editor, since we don't follow any
 convention. To translate a level's tile, to French, for instance, just do this:
 (name "Hello World!")
 (name-fr "Bonjour Monde!")
 Other data files, like texts in data/, can be translated the same way:
 (text "Hello World!
       Bye World!")
 (text-fr "Bonjour Monde!
           Au revoir Monde!")


 == DEVELOPERS ==

1. Translatable Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Output should not be translated, since their purpose is mainly for debugging.
 However, command description (ie. --help) should obviously be translated. Messages
 that give the user a solution for a problem, might be translatable, as well.

 Parametars shouldn't also be translatable. It breaks scripting, besides advanced users,
 the ones that will make use of this, usually don't like it.
