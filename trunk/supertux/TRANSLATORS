                        - SuperTux Translation info -

Last update: June 4, 2004


1. Notes for Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If there isn't a good translation for some term (ie. fullscreen), you might
  consider to just keep it. It's better than making the user confused.

* In English, there is only one singular second person mode (You). If your
  language does have more than one - a personal and impersonal - remember that
  this is a game, so you should use the personal one. However, if it is
  possible to ommit it in your language, it might be a good idea.

* Names like SuperTux, Tux, Penny and other game elements should not be
  translated. If you really think one of these to be a too strange word for
  your people, first inform us at our mailing list.

* Translating lots of strings can be boring and time consuming, but, in my
  opinion, it worths when lookins at the results ;-)

* If somewhere in the game, after translating a string, it doesn't look well
  (bad aligment, overlaps other text...), contact us. We might be able to change
  to code.

* There are programs that help with translating: KBable and the gettext Emacs
  plugin can give your productivity a huge boost.

* Please read gettext documentation on how to start translating.
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_5.html#SEC29

* After translating the file, add it to LINGUAS (ie. Spanish - es) and run
  'make update-po'.

* You currently have to install supertux to see the results of the translation.

* Currently, only the game itself is translatable. Data files, like levels, 
  credits, story... are not yet translatable (but that is planed for later).



2. DEVELOPERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Debugging output should not be translated. That is everything that goes to the
  console except error messages and the usage text of the program.

* Parametars shouldn't also be translatable.
