These are mostly bugs:

Todo
----
H: high priority
M: medium priority
L: low priority
?: bug or feature?

[L] AX_CHECK_GL produces an error during configure, when something in
    configure.ac changed and it was automatically regenerated by make (instead
    of the user doing ./autogen.sh)
[H] Change resolution to 800x600
     - Levels need to be updated to resolution
     - Might still be some other bugs to iron out
[H] Buttjump related things
     - Right now only breaks bricks beneath tux - what else should it break
     - Breaks 1 box too much at the left when tux is facing left.
     - Should kill enemies with a certain range
     - Should disable Tux Temporarily - matze: what does this mean?
     - Animation (need images)

[H] Camera movement shouldn't be so fast at the beggining, it takes the focus from
    the game (backscrolling)
[H] Tux should fall while walking in tiles that have a space between.

[M] Save score on per-level basis to make high-score
[M] Save time on per-level basis to make low-time-score
[M] Add bonus score for extra time left when finishing a level
[M] When aborting a level, lives and score should remain the same as they
    were before. Solution: make more dependency between the game engine and worldmap
    or just backup those variables before starting a level. - fixed?
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[H] Enemies should turn upside down after being hit by an kicked
   iceblock, fireball or bomb
[?] When jumping into a brick and there is a powerup, it should change
    direction or not, depending where the collision was. It currently sucks.
    - Discuss this, is that really what we want?

[M] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[M] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time
   bouncing on the roof

[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
   menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
   instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
   menu)
[L] catch exceptions thrown by lispreader
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice


Stuff for past milestone1:
--------------------------
Note that this list is far from complete, but lists some bugs that we don't want
to touch before milestone1 at the moment.
- You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
- bombs should explode directly when hit by another bomb or a mr.iceblock
- we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
  per block.
- We should reduced the width of tux collision rectangle so that he falls easier
  between 1 tile wide holes.
- The enabled/disabled icon in the options shouldn't be a cross. Some people
  think the options are disabled because they're crossed. Better use a green
  check mark.
