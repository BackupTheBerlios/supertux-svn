- To do for Milestone2 -
http://super-tux.sf.net/

High priority: milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone
Medium priority: would be nice to have for next milestone, but should
    be secondary to high priority goals
Low priority: things that should be fixed sometime
?: Things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be
    implemented

Todo
----
H: high priority
M: medium priority
L: low priority
?: bug or feature?
    - needs discussion

--Scons--
 * [H] Add an install target
 * [M] improve opengl check to work on win32 and eventually more strange
   systems again
 * [H] Make sure compilation on win32 and cross-compilation works
 * [M] compile some test executables to test for SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image.
   Also test for version of SDL_mixer and SDL_image
 * [M] Create a distclean target
 * [M] Create a dist target
 * [M] Add instructions to the README
 * [L] If all of the [H] and [M] issues are fixed, remove autoconf/automake
 * [L] Take a look if it is possible to make it a bit more quiet. (Similar to
     linux kernel, samba or jam output would be optimum, ie.
       C++ build/linux/src/bla.o
       C++ build/linux/src/blup.o
       C++ build/linux/src/error.o
          Error on line xx in error.o: This source contained an error

       g++ -Wall .... -o build/linux/src/error.o src/error.cpp

--Miscelaneous--
[?] Default keyboard setup should change. Up will be needed for other features
    like going through doors and looking up, etc.
  Up arrow    - Look up / activate
  Down arrow  - Look down / duck
  Left arrow  - Left move
  Right arrow - Right move
  Ctrl        - Run / Power
  Space       - Jump

[H] Worldmap should have a flag to allow to go to another map after finishing
    a level from that one.
    It might be cool to have a (place group in the worldmap file that would
    allow such stuff as: levels, messages, wrapping and worldmap changing
    (or even combinations).
[H] Change resolution to 800x600
     - Levels need to be updated to resolution
        - half of the levels have been already updated
        - some fixed levels still have "glitches". See the menu level where
          some of the tiles are "wrong" and don't fit
[H] Buttjump related things
     - Should kill enemies with a certain range
        - Done--now needs to be tweaked
     - Animation (need images)
     - Should be a powerup item (still to be discussed)
     - Should break bricks if Tux is on top of bricks, otherwise it should
       kill enemies within a close range.
        - After enemy-kill is used, powerup should be removed from Tux
[H] Icebullet related things
     - we should decide on specifics
[H] Tux should fall while walking in tiles that have a space between.
     - Possible solution: reduce Tux's width when checking collision with tiles
[H] Graphics
     - New forest tileset
     - Badguy sprites
     - Tux's buttjump animation
[H] Background code have the following bugs:
 - Gradient in software rendering doesn't currently work (at least here).
    Matze: can you give more details? The code looks perfectly fine to me

[M] There are some weird graphical glitches when Tux bumps more than one block
    at the same time
[M] Save score on per-level basis to make high-score
[M] Save time on per-level basis to make low-time-score
[M] Add bonus score for extra time left when finishing a level
[M] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[M] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time bouncing on
[M] You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
    the roof
[M] Implement Unisolid type for tiles (where collisions from below are ignored).
    - done

[L] Allow any object to be inside of a [?] box, ie. trampoline or badguy
    - Not sure if this would be gameplay wise.
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
    menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
    instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
    menu)
[L] catch exceptions thrown by lispreader

Beyond Milestone2
-----------------
- More things than just levels on the worldmap (similar to SMB3)
