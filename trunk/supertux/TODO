- To do for Milestone1 -
http://super-tux.sf.net/

Last update: April 26, 2004

These are mostly bugs:

Todo
----
L: low priority

[L] change lispreader to throw exceptions instead of simply assert() on
    syntax error
[L] tux sometimes makes short jumps in the endsequence, mostly when
    going through the goal with a small jump, might be old_up related
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
[L] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction

- leveleditor lacks enemies support (will be fixed soon by Tobias)

Stuff for past milestone1:
--------------------------
Note that this list is far from complete, but lists some bugs that we don't want
to touch before milestone1 at the moment.
- You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
- bombs should explode directly when hit by another bomb or a mr.iceblock
- we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
  per block.
- We should reduced the width of tux collision rectangle so that he falls easier
  between 1 tile wide holes.

Fixed
-----

- points aren't reset when gameover
- when jumping into the exit with a star, the endgame music will change back to
  levelmusic after a short time
- when jupming against the 2nd multiple coin block in a level only 1 coin will
  come out.
- when you interrupted the intro (by going to credits for example) and go back
  to it, tux doesn't jump anymore
- supertux crashs from time to time - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't fall down when being squished in the air - fixed
- It's not possible to duck while jumping - fixed
- Intro/Extro textspeed is CPU dependent - fixed
- sometimes the level restarts/you die after collecing a growup - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't disapear after being kicked my another iceblock,
  not sure when exactly it happens, might depend on direction or so - fixed
