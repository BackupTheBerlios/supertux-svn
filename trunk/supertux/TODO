High priority: milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone
Medium priority: would be nice to have for next milestone, but should
    be secondary to high priority goals
Low priority: things that should be fixed sometime
?: Things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be
    implemented

Todo
----
H: high priority
M: medium priority
L: low priority
?: bug or feature?
    - needs discussion

[?] When jumping into a brick and there is a powerup, it should change
    direction or not, depending where the collision was. It currently sucks.
     - Discuss this, is that really what we want?
[?] Default keyboard setup should change. Up will be needed for other features
    like going through doors and looking up, etc.

[H] Change resolution to 800x600
     - Levels need to be updated to resolution
         (half of the levels have been already updated)
[H] Buttjump related things
     ? Right now only breaks bricks beneath tux - what else should it break
     - Breaks 1 box too much at the left when tux is facing left.
     - Should kill enemies with a certain range
     - Animation (need images)
     ? Should disable Tux's movement temporarily (1 second?)
[H] Tux should fall while walking in tiles that have a space between.
     - Possible solution: reduce Tux's width when checking collision with tiles

[M] Save score on per-level basis to make high-score
[M] Save time on per-level basis to make low-time-score
[M] Add bonus score for extra time left when finishing a level
[M] When aborting a level, lives and score should remain the same as they
    were before. Solution: make more dependency between the game engine and
    worldmap or just backup those variables before starting a level. - fixed?
[M] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[M] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time bouncing on
[M] You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
    the roof
[M] bombs should explode directly when hit by another bomb or a mr.iceblock
     - right now they transform into a "squished mrbomb"

[L] Allow any object to be inside of a [?] box, ie. trampoline or badguy
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
    menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
    instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
    menu)
[L] catch exceptions thrown by lispreader
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
[L] we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
    per block.
[L] AX_CHECK_GL produces an error during configure, when something in
    configure.ac changed and it was automatically regenerated by make (instead
    of the user doing ./autogen.sh)


Beyond Milestone2
-----------------
- More things than just levels on the worldmap (similar to SMB3)
