- To do for Milestone1 -

Last update: May 3, 2004

These are mostly bugs:

Todo
----
H: high priority
L: low priority

[M] Enemies can get stuck when colliding.
[M] When aborting a level, lives and score should remain the same as they
    were before. Solution: make more dependency between the game engine and worldmap
    or just backup those variables before starting a level.
[M] When jumping into a brick and there is a powerup, it should change direction or not,
    depending where the collision was. It currently sucks.
[M] Tux should fall while walking in tiles that have a space between.
[M] Camera movement shouldn't be so fast at the beggining, it takes the focus from
    the game.
[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
   menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
   instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
   menu)
[L] change lispreader to throw exceptions instead of simply assert() on
    syntax error
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
[L] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[L] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time
   bouncing on the roof
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[L] Enemies should turn upside down after being hit by an kicked
   iceblock


Stuff for past milestone1:
--------------------------
Note that this list is far from complete, but lists some bugs that we don't want
to touch before milestone1 at the moment.
- You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
- bombs should explode directly when hit by another bomb or a mr.iceblock
- we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
  per block.
- We should reduced the width of tux collision rectangle so that he falls easier
  between 1 tile wide holes.
- The enabled/disabled icon in the options shouldn't be a cross. Some people
  think the options are disabled because they're crossed. Better use a green
  check mark.
