High priority: milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone
Medium priority: would be nice to have for next milestone, but should
    be secondary to high priority goals
Low priority: things that should be fixed sometime
?: Things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be
    implemented

Todo
----
H: high priority
M: medium priority
L: low priority
?: bug or feature?
    - needs discussion

[?] Default keyboard setup should change. Up will be needed for other features
    like going through doors and looking up, etc.

[H] Worldmap needs to allow multiple maps
     - or just one big map with multiple worlds?
[H] Change resolution to 800x600
     - Levels need to be updated to resolution
        - half of the levels have been already updated
        - some fixed levels still have "glitches". See the menu level where
          some of the tiles are "wrong" and don't fit
[H] Buttjump related things
     - Should kill enemies with a certain range
        - Done--now needs to be tweaked
     - Animation (need images)
     - Should be a powerup item
     - Should break bricks if Tux is on top of bricks, otherwise it should
       kill enemies within a close range.
        - After enemy-kill is used, powerup should be removed from Tux
[H] Icebullet related things
     - we should decide on specifics
[H] Tux should fall while walking in tiles that have a space between.
     - Possible solution: reduce Tux's width when checking collision with tiles
[H] stdint.h isn't a part of FreeBSD. We should probably use SDL integer
    types instead.
[H] Graphics
     - New forest tileset
     - Badguy sprites
     - Tux's buttjump animation
[H] Backgrounds should be square tiles instead of just tiling one image
     - Useful for vertical scrolling when we only want a sky background on the
       top of the level
     - Support for this is already available using a paralax tilemap layer

[M] There are some weird graphical glitches when Tux bumps more than one block
    at the same time
[M] Save score on per-level basis to make high-score
[M] Save time on per-level basis to make low-time-score
[M] Add bonus score for extra time left when finishing a level
[M] When aborting a level, lives and score should remain the same as they
    were before. Solution: make more dependency between the game engine and
    worldmap or just backup those variables before starting a level. - fixed?
[M] when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
[M] tux get killed if he kicks a iceblock while at the same time bouncing on
[M] You shouldn't be able to stand on invisible blocks, before you bumped them
    the roof

[L] Allow any object to be inside of a [?] box, ie. trampoline or badguy
[L] in the "Welcome to Antarctica" level, the blocks next to the first growup
    look like there are 2 blocks above each other when bumping against them as
    small tux...
[L] time runs while being in in-game menu, at least a bit (jump, go to
    menu, wait a bit, leave menu, Tux will 'flip' to the ground,
    instead of fall, pause mode doesn't seem to have this problem, only
    menu)
[L] catch exceptions thrown by lispreader
[L] fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
[L] we only have a global counter for multiple coin blocks. This should be handled
    per block.
[L] Show level number on top of the screen when playing the level
[L] fix the door animation

Beyond Milestone2

- More things than just levels on the worldmap (similar to SMB3)
