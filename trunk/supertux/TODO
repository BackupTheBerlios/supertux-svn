These are mostly bugs:

- supertux crashs from time to time - fixed
- leveleditor lacks enemies support (will be fixed soon by Tobias)
- sometimes you die after being in pause modus and unpausing - still true?
- sometimes the level restarts/you die after collecing a growup - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't disapear after being kicked my another iceblock,
  not sure when exactly it happens, might depend on direction or so - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't fall down when being squished in the air - fixed
- It's not possible to duck while jumping - fixed
- Intro/Extro textspeed is CPU dependent - fixed
- fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
