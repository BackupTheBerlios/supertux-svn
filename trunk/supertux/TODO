These are mostly bugs:

Todo
----

- fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
- when you interrupted the intro (by going to credits for example) and go back
  to it, tux doesn't jump anymore
- when jupming against the 2nd multiple coin block in a level only 1 coin will
  come out.
- In the "Oh No More Snowballs" map, there's a ?-Growup-Block at the beginning
  with only 1 tile space above it
- when jumping into the exit with a star, the endgame music will change back to
  levelmusic after a short time
- the can_jump flag should be based on a time instead of the 2 tiles check.
  Since the 2 tiles flag won't help when you're jumping over a hole. Better use
  a timer that is started when up is pressed, when you then land and the timer
  is below a certain time, you can do the jump.
- when bumping a special with 2 blocks at once, it won't change direction
- points aren't reset when gameover

- leveleditor lacks enemies support (will be fixed soon by Tobias)
- sometimes you die after being in pause modus and unpausing - still true?


Fixed
-----

- supertux crashs from time to time - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't fall down when being squished in the air - fixed
- It's not possible to duck while jumping - fixed
- Intro/Extro textspeed is CPU dependent - fixed
- sometimes the level restarts/you die after collecing a growup - fixed
- mriceblock doesn't disapear after being kicked my another iceblock,
  not sure when exactly it happens, might depend on direction or so - fixed
