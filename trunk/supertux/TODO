These are mostly bugs:

- supertux crashs from time to time
- leveleditor lacks enemies support (will be fixed soon by Tobias)
- sometimes you die after being in pause modus and unpausing
- sometimes the level restarts/you die after collecing a growup
- mriceblock doesn't disapear after being kicked my another iceblock,
  not sure when exactly it happens, might depend on direction or so
- fadein/out for intro/extro would be nice
